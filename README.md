Most of the gem's included in this file were generated by Rails but I shall walk you through why some of the important ones were used:
1. Neo4j: The Neo4j gem is what allowed us to switch our Ruby on Rails application from using SQlite to Neo4j. Neo4j allows you to shape your models as nodes and relationships, as well as communicating with Neo4j databases.
2. HTTParty: As the name suggests, HTTParty was used to handle HTTP networking requests between the Ruby on Rails application and the database as well as to the Best Buy API.
3. FactoryGirlRails: Factory Girl is a testing application that allows you to create dummy data to fulfill your models throughout testing, very useful gem while testing or before any models are even implemented.
